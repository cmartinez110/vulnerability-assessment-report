<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Report</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
As a recently onboarded cybersecurity analyst at an e-commerce corporation, I find myself in a unique position. The organization maintains a remote database server to accommodate its globally dispersed workforce. Regularly, employees from various corners of the world request data from this server, primarily for identifying potential customers.

I've been tasked with performing a vulnerability assessment and presenting a report to leadership. it has come to my attention that the database has been openly accessible to the public for the past three years since the company's inception. In my role as a cybersecurity expert, I will apply this to the scope of the assessment and discern the significance of addressing this situation promptly, as keeping the database open to public access represents a substantial security vulnerability that must be mitigated.
